# Unit-2 Design-a-Basic-Mobile-and-Web-Layout-for-an-Existing-Case-Study
## AIM
To design mobile and web layouts for an existing case study by applying Gestalt principles, UI elements, interaction behaviors, usability guidelines, and branding through logo creation.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today’s digital landscape, effective UI/UX design is essential for the success of mobile and web applications. This experiment aims to enhance layouts by leveraging Gestalt principles, UI components, usability standards, and consistent branding.

## DESIGN STEPS
### A. Applying Gestalt Principles to Layout Design

• Proximity: Group related interface elements for better clarity

• Similarity: Maintain visual consistency for actions and categories

• Continuity: Guide users naturally through content flow

• Closure: Use design elements that lead to complete visual forms

• These principles help users intuitively navigate the interface and enhance comprehension.

### B. Incorporating UI Elements and Design Patterns
Implemented elements:

• Navigation bars
• Buttons
• Cards
• Responsive grid systems

Design patterns:

### C. Interaction Behaviors and Usability Principles

• Easy navigation across screens

• Visual and tactile feedback on interaction

• Accessibility features (readable text, proper contrast)

• Consistency in visual design and user flows

• Prioritized intuitive user experience

## DESIGNS
### Mobile and Web Layout with Branding
(Images or links to Figma/Canva designs can be added here)

• Mobile layout reflects simplified navigation and larger touch targets

• Web layout leverages structured grid for desktop viewing

• Unified branding applied across both formats

## FLOWCHART OF USER INTERACTION

(Insert or link a flowchart image here – e.g., created in Miro, draw.io, or Figma)
Describes user actions from landing on homepage → browsing items → interacting with UI → completing key tasks.
